This is a brief description on the files hierarchy so that you can understand how to create new React components:
there is two main folders that you will be using most of the time 1-Pages , 2-Components.
In every directory there will be subdirectories for each component or page and for debugging purposes make sure to include every .css and unit test files in the directory of each distinct component. Below is an example:
Account.jsx,AccountUnitTest.jsx,Account.css belongs----->Account directory belongs-----> Pages directory (./Pages/Account/Account.jsx for example)
